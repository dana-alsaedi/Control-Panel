# Control Panel
## Explanation of IOT and software development Department task:
## - Design control interface for moving the base

For my task, I started with creating a database to control the base then I connect the database with the control interface as a web page for controlling the movement of the robot.

On this web page, we will control the angles of the motors and the range of the servo motor from 0 to 180. Also, the direction of the movement such as right-left and so on.

in the end, we combined the robot arm control panel with the base control panel in one interface.
